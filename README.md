Jubblution
==========

A little pygame experiment from a few years back. Randomly generated 'jubbles' move around the screen. Each jubble preys on smaller jubbles and runs away from larger jubbles.

Requirements
------------

* Python 2.6.x-2.7.x
* `pygame` module

Usage
-----

    python jubbles.py
    

Happy jubbling!
