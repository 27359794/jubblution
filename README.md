Jubblution README
=================

You'd have to be an idiot to not get this to work. Download jubbles.py, run
it. Simple as that.

* pygame obviously has to be installed first. On ubuntu:

    apt-get install python-pygame

* guaranteed to work on Python 2.6. Will probably work on 2.5 and 2.6+. On
  anything else, results may vary.

Happy jubbling!
